		A filter that specifies a quality bar for how much filtering is done to identify faces. Filtered faces aren't searched for in the collection. If you specify AUTO, Amazon Rekognition chooses the quality bar. If you specify LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH, filtering removes all faces that donâ€™t meet the chosen quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Low-quality detections can occur for a number of reasons. Some examples are an object that's misidentified as a face, a face that's too blurry, or a face with a pose that's too extreme to use. If you specify NONE, no filtering is performed. The default value is NONE.  To use quality filtering, the collection you are using must be associated with version 3 of the face model or higher.
