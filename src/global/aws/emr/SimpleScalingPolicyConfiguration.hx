		The way in which EC2 instances are added (if ScalingAdjustment is a positive number) or terminated (if ScalingAdjustment is a negative number) each time the scaling activity is triggered.

PERCENT_CHANGE_IN_CAPACITY indicates the instance count increments or decrements by the percentage specified by ScalingAdjustment, which should be expressed as an integer. For example, 20 indicates an increase in 20% increments of cluster capacity. EXACT_CAPACITY indicates the scaling activity results in an instance group with the number of EC2 instances specified by ScalingAdjustment, which should be expressed as a positive integer.

		The amount by which to scale in or scale out, based on the specified AdjustmentType. A positive value adds to the instance group's EC2 instance count while a negative number removes instances. If AdjustmentType is set to EXACT_CAPACITY, the number should only be a positive integer. If AdjustmentType is set to PERCENT_CHANGE_IN_CAPACITY, the value should express the percentage as an integer. For example, -20 indicates a decrease in 20% increments of cluster capacity.
