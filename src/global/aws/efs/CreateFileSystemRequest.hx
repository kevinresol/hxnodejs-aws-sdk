		The ID of the AWS KMS CMK to be used to protect the encrypted file system. This parameter is only required if you want to use a nondefault CMK. If this parameter is not specified, the default CMK for Amazon EFS is used. This ID can be in one of the following formats:   Key ID - A unique identifier of the key, for example 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.   ARN - An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the key, for example arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.   Key alias - A previously created display name for a key, for example alias/projectKey1.   Key alias ARN - An ARN for a key alias, for example arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:444455556666:alias/projectKey1.   If KmsKeyId is specified, the CreateFileSystemRequest$Encrypted parameter must be set to true.  EFS accepts only symmetric CMKs. You cannot use asymmetric CMKs with EFS file systems.

You can decrease your file system's throughput in Provisioned Throughput mode or change between the throughput modes as long as itâ€™s been more than 24 hours since the last decrease or throughput mode change.
