	/**
		The state of the instance as a 16-bit unsigned integer.  The high byte is all of the bits between 2^8 and (2^16)-1, which equals decimal values between 256 and 65,535. These numerical values are used for internal purposes and should be ignored. The low byte is all of the bits between 2^0 and (2^8)-1, which equals decimal values between 0 and 255.  The valid values for instance-state-code will all be in the range of the low byte and they are:    0 : pending     16 : running     32 : shutting-down     48 : terminated     64 : stopping     80 : stopped    You can ignore the high byte value by zeroing out all of the bits above 2^8 or 256 in decimal.
