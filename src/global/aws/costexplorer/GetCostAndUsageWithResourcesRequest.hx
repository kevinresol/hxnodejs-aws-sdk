		Which metrics are returned in the query. For more information about blended and unblended rates, see Why does the "blended" annotation appear on some line items in my bill?.  Valid values are AmortizedCost, BlendedCost, NetAmortizedCost, NetUnblendedCost, NormalizedUsageAmount, UnblendedCost, and UsageQuantity.   If you return the UsageQuantity metric, the service aggregates all usage numbers without taking the units into account. For example, if you aggregate usageQuantity across all of Amazon EC2, the results aren't meaningful because Amazon EC2 compute hours and data transfer are measured in different units (for example, hours vs. GB). To get more meaningful UsageQuantity metrics, filter by UsageType or UsageTypeGroups.    Metrics is required for GetCostAndUsageWithResources requests.
