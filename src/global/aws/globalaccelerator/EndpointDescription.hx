		The weight associated with the endpoint. When you add weights to endpoints, you configure AWS Global Accelerator to route traffic based on proportions that you specify. For example, you might specify endpoint weights of 4, 5, 5, and 6 (sum=20). The result is that 4/20 of your traffic, on average, is routed to the first endpoint, 5/20 is routed both to the second and third endpoints, and 6/20 is routed to the last endpoint. For more information, see Endpoint Weights in the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide.

		The reason code associated with why the endpoint is not healthy. If the endpoint state is healthy, a reason code is not provided. If the endpoint state is unhealthy, the reason code can be one of the following values:    Timeout: The health check requests to the endpoint are timing out before returning a status.    Failed: The health check failed, for example because the endpoint response was invalid (malformed).   If the endpoint state is initial, the reason code can be one of the following values:    ProvisioningInProgress: The endpoint is in the process of being provisioned.    InitialHealthChecking: Global Accelerator is still setting up the minimum number of health checks for the endpoint that are required to determine its health status.

		Indicates whether client IP address preservation is enabled for an Application Load Balancer endpoint. The value is true or false. The default value is true for new accelerators.  If the value is set to true, the client's IP address is preserved in the X-Forwarded-For request header as traffic travels to applications on the Application Load Balancer endpoint fronted by the accelerator. For more information, see  Viewing Client IP Addresses in AWS Global Accelerator in the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide.
