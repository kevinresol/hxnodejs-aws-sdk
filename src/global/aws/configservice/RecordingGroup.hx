		Specifies whether AWS Config includes all supported types of global resources (for example, IAM resources) with the resources that it records. Before you can set this option to true, you must set the allSupported option to true. If you set this option to true, when AWS Config adds support for a new type of global resource, it starts recording resources of that type automatically. The configuration details for any global resource are the same in all regions. To prevent duplicate configuration items, you should consider customizing AWS Config in only one region to record global resources.
