Statistics: The most useful statistics are Maximum and Average.  Unit: The published unit is Percent.     DatabaseConnections  - The number of database connections in use.  Statistics: The most useful statistics are Maximum and Sum.  Unit: The published unit is Count.     DiskQueueDepth  - The number of outstanding IOs (read/write requests) that are waiting to access the disk.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Sum.  Unit: The published unit is Count.     FreeStorageSpace  - The amount of available storage space.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Sum.  Unit: The published unit is Bytes.     NetworkReceiveThroughput  - The incoming (Receive) network traffic on the database, including both customer database traffic and AWS traffic used for monitoring and replication.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Average.  Unit: The published unit is Bytes/Second.     NetworkTransmitThroughput  - The outgoing (Transmit) network traffic on the database, including both customer database traffic and AWS traffic used for monitoring and replication.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Average.  Unit: The published unit is Bytes/Second.

		The statistic for the metric. The following statistics are available:    Minimum - The lowest value observed during the specified period. Use this value to determine low volumes of activity for your application.    Maximum - The highest value observed during the specified period. Use this value to determine high volumes of activity for your application.    Sum - All values submitted for the matching metric added together. You can use this statistic to determine the total volume of a metric.    Average - The value of Sum / SampleCount during the specified period. By comparing this statistic with the Minimum and Maximum values, you can determine the full scope of a metric and how close the average use is to the Minimum and Maximum values. This comparison helps you to know when to increase or decrease your resources.    SampleCount - The count, or number, of data points used for the statistical calculation.
