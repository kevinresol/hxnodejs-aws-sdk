		Specifies whether to automatically assign an Elastic public IP address to WorkSpaces in this directory by default. If enabled, the Elastic public IP address allows outbound internet access from your WorkSpaces when youâ€™re using an internet gateway in the Amazon VPC in which your WorkSpaces are located. If you're using a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway for outbound internet access from your VPC, or if your WorkSpaces are in public subnets and you manually assign them Elastic IP addresses, you should disable this setting. This setting applies to new WorkSpaces that you launch or to existing WorkSpaces that you rebuild. For more information, see  Configure a VPC for Amazon WorkSpaces.
