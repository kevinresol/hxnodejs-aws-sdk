Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes).   Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour).

		When you are using a Put operation, this defines what unit you want to use when storing the metric. In a Get operation, if you omit Unit then all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only data data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.
