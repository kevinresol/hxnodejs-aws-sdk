		The allocation strategy to use for the compute resource in case not enough instances of the best fitting instance type can be allocated. This could be due to availability of the instance type in the region or Amazon EC2 service limits. If this is not specified, the default is BEST_FIT, which will use only the best fitting instance type, waiting for additional capacity if it's not available. This allocation strategy keeps costs lower but can limit scaling. If you are using Spot Fleets with BEST_FIT then the Spot Fleet IAM Role must be specified. BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE will select additional instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types with a lower cost per vCPU. SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED is only available for Spot Instance compute resources and will select additional instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types that are less likely to be interrupted. For more information, see Allocation Strategies in the AWS Batch User Guide.
