		When you use the OutputDataConfig object while creating a custom classifier, you specify the Amazon S3 location where you want to write the confusion matrix. The URI must be in the same region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The location is used as the prefix for the actual location of this output file. When the custom classifier job is finished, the service creates the output file in a directory specific to the job. The S3Uri field contains the location of the output file, called output.tar.gz. It is a compressed archive that contains the confusion matrix.
