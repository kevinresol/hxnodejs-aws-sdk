		The maximum number of cluster results returned by ListClusters in paginated output. When this parameter is used, ListClusters only returns maxResults results in a single page along with a nextToken response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another ListClusters request with the returned nextToken value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter is not used, then ListClusters returns up to 100 results and a nextToken value if applicable.
