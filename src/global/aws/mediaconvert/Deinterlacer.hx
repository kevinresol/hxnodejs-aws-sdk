		Only applies when you set Deinterlacer (DeinterlaceMode) to Deinterlace (DEINTERLACE) or Adaptive (ADAPTIVE). Motion adaptive interpolate (INTERPOLATE) produces sharper pictures, while blend (BLEND) produces smoother motion. Use (INTERPOLATE_TICKER) OR (BLEND_TICKER) if your source file includes a ticker, such as a scrolling headline at the bottom of the frame.

		- When set to NORMAL (default), the deinterlacer does not convert frames that are tagged  in metadata as progressive. It will only convert those that are tagged as some other type. - When set to FORCE_ALL_FRAMES, the deinterlacer converts every frame to progressive - even those that are already tagged as progressive. Turn Force mode on only if there is  a good chance that the metadata has tagged frames as progressive when they are not  progressive. Do not turn on otherwise; processing frames that are already progressive  into progressive will probably result in lower quality video.
