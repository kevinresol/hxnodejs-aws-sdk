		Ignore this setting unless your input captions are SCC format and you want both 608 and 708 captions embedded in your output stream. Optionally, specify the 708 service number for each output captions channel. Choose a different number for each channel. To use this setting, also set Force 608 to 708 upconvert (Convert608To708) to Upconvert (UPCONVERT) in your input captions selector settings. If you choose to upconvert but don't specify a 708 service number, MediaConvert uses the number that you specify for CC channel number (destination608ChannelNumber) for the 708 service number. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/mediaconvert/dual-scc-to-embedded.
