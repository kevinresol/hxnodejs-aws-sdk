		Generates a report that includes details about when an IAM resource (user, group, role, or policy) was last used in an attempt to access AWS services. Recent activity usually appears within four hours. IAM reports activity for the last 365 days, or less if your Region began supporting this feature within the last year. For more information, see Regions Where Data Is Tracked.  The service last accessed data includes all attempts to access an AWS API, not just the successful ones. This includes all attempts that were made using the AWS Management Console, the AWS API through any of the SDKs, or any of the command line tools. An unexpected entry in the service last accessed data does not mean that your account has been compromised, because the request might have been denied. Refer to your CloudTrail logs as the authoritative source for information about all API calls and whether they were successful or denied access. For more information, see Logging IAM Events with CloudTrail in the IAM User Guide.  The GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails operation returns a JobId. Use this parameter in the following operations to retrieve the following details from your report:     GetServiceLastAccessedDetails – Use this operation for users, groups, roles, or policies to list every AWS service that the resource could access using permissions policies. For each service, the response includes information about the most recent access attempt. The JobId returned by GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetail must be used by the same role within a session, or by the same user when used to call GetServiceLastAccessedDetail.    GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities – Use this operation for groups and policies to list information about the associated entities (users or roles) that attempted to access a specific AWS service.    To check the status of the GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails request, use the JobId parameter in the same operations and test the JobStatus response parameter. For additional information about the permissions policies that allow an identity (user, group, or role) to access specific services, use the ListPoliciesGrantingServiceAccess operation.  Service last accessed data does not use other policy types when determining whether a resource could access a service. These other policy types include resource-based policies, access control lists, AWS Organizations policies, IAM permissions boundaries, and AWS STS assume role policies. It only applies permissions policy logic. For more about the evaluation of policy types, see Evaluating Policies in the IAM User Guide.  For more information about service and action last accessed data, see Reducing Permissions Using Service Last Accessed Data in the IAM User Guide.

You can use the JobId parameter in GetServiceLastAccessedDetails to retrieve the status of your report job. When the report is complete, you can retrieve the generated report. The report includes a list of AWS services that the resource (user, group, role, or managed policy) can access.  Service last accessed data does not use other policy types when determining whether a resource could access a service. These other policy types include resource-based policies, access control lists, AWS Organizations policies, IAM permissions boundaries, and AWS STS assume role policies. It only applies permissions policy logic. For more about the evaluation of policy types, see Evaluating Policies in the IAM User Guide.  For each service that the resource could access using permissions policies, the operation returns details about the most recent access attempt. If there was no attempt, the service is listed without details about the most recent attempt to access the service. If the operation fails, the GetServiceLastAccessedDetails operation returns the reason that it failed. The GetServiceLastAccessedDetails operation returns a list of services. This list includes the number of entities that have attempted to access the service and the date and time of the last attempt.

		Retrieves a service last accessed report that was created using the GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails operation. You can use the JobId parameter in GetServiceLastAccessedDetails to retrieve the status of your report job. When the report is complete, you can retrieve the generated report. The report includes a list of AWS services that the resource (user, group, role, or managed policy) can access.  Service last accessed data does not use other policy types when determining whether a resource could access a service. These other policy types include resource-based policies, access control lists, AWS Organizations policies, IAM permissions boundaries, and AWS STS assume role policies. It only applies permissions policy logic. For more about the evaluation of policy types, see Evaluating Policies in the IAM User Guide.  For each service that the resource could access using permissions policies, the operation returns details about the most recent access attempt. If there was no attempt, the service is listed without details about the most recent attempt to access the service. If the operation fails, the GetServiceLastAccessedDetails operation returns the reason that it failed. The GetServiceLastAccessedDetails operation returns a list of services. This list includes the number of entities that have attempted to access the service and the date and time of the last attempt. It also returns the ARN of the following entity, depending on the resource ARN that you used to generate the report:    User – Returns the user ARN that you used to generate the report    Group – Returns the ARN of the group member (user) that last attempted to access the service    Role – Returns the role ARN that you used to generate the report    Policy – Returns the ARN of the user or role that last used the policy to attempt to access the service   By default, the list is sorted by service namespace.

		Adds one or more tags to an IAM role. The role can be a regular role or a service-linked role. If a tag with the same key name already exists, then that tag is overwritten with the new value. A tag consists of a key name and an associated value. By assigning tags to your resources, you can do the following:    Administrative grouping and discovery - Attach tags to resources to aid in organization and search. For example, you could search for all resources with the key name Project and the value MyImportantProject. Or search for all resources with the key name Cost Center and the value 41200.     Access control - Reference tags in IAM user-based and resource-based policies. You can use tags to restrict access to only an IAM user or role that has a specified tag attached. You can also restrict access to only those resources that have a certain tag attached. For examples of policies that show how to use tags to control access, see Control Access Using IAM Tags in the IAM User Guide.    Cost allocation - Use tags to help track which individuals and teams are using which AWS resources.      Make sure that you have no invalid tags and that you do not exceed the allowed number of tags per role. In either case, the entire request fails and no tags are added to the role.   AWS always interprets the tag Value as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.    For more information about tagging, see Tagging IAM Identities in the IAM User Guide.
		
		Adds one or more tags to an IAM role. The role can be a regular role or a service-linked role. If a tag with the same key name already exists, then that tag is overwritten with the new value. A tag consists of a key name and an associated value. By assigning tags to your resources, you can do the following:    Administrative grouping and discovery - Attach tags to resources to aid in organization and search. For example, you could search for all resources with the key name Project and the value MyImportantProject. Or search for all resources with the key name Cost Center and the value 41200.
