The regex pattern for a parent ID string requires one of the following:    Root - A string that begins with "r-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.    Organizational unit (OU) - A string that begins with "ou-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits (the ID of the root that the OU is in). This string is followed by a second "-" dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase letters or digits.

		The total number of results that you want included on each page of the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value that is specific to the operation. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the NextToken response element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the NextToken request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results. Note that Organizations might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check NextToken after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.
