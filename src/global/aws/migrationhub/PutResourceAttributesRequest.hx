		Information about the resource that is being migrated. This data will be used to map the task to a resource in the Application Discovery Service repository.  Takes the object array of ResourceAttribute where the Type field is reserved for the following values: IPV4_ADDRESS | IPV6_ADDRESS | MAC_ADDRESS | FQDN | VM_MANAGER_ID | VM_MANAGED_OBJECT_REFERENCE | VM_NAME | VM_PATH | BIOS_ID | MOTHERBOARD_SERIAL_NUMBER where the identifying value can be a string up to 256 characters.     If any "VM" related value is set for a ResourceAttribute object, it is required that VM_MANAGER_ID, as a minimum, is always set. If VM_MANAGER_ID is not set, then all "VM" fields will be discarded and "VM" fields will not be used for matching the migration task to a server in Application Discovery Service repository. See the Example section below for a use case of specifying "VM" related values.    If a server you are trying to match has multiple IP or MAC addresses, you should provide as many as you know in separate type/value pairs passed to the ResourceAttributeList parameter to maximize the chances of matching.
