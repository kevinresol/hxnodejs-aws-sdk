		Specifies the encryption context to use when decrypting the data. An encryption context is valid only for cryptographic operations with a symmetric CMK. The standard asymmetric encryption algorithms that AWS KMS uses do not support an encryption context. An encryption context is a collection of non-secret key-value pairs that represents additional authenticated data. When you use an encryption context to encrypt data, you must specify the same (an exact case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data. An encryption context is optional when encrypting with a symmetric CMK, but it is highly recommended. For more information, see Encryption Context in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

	/**
		Specifies the customer master key (CMK) that AWS KMS will use to decrypt the ciphertext. Enter a key ID of the CMK that was used to encrypt the ciphertext. If you specify a KeyId value, the Decrypt operation succeeds only if the specified CMK was used to encrypt the ciphertext. This parameter is required only when the ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric CMK. Otherwise, AWS KMS uses the metadata that it adds to the ciphertext blob to determine which CMK was used to encrypt the ciphertext. However, you can use this parameter to ensure that a particular CMK (of any kind) is used to decrypt the ciphertext. To specify a CMK, use its key ID, Amazon Resource Name (ARN), alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with "alias/". For example:   Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab    Key ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab    Alias name: alias/ExampleAlias    Alias ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias    To get the key ID and key ARN for a CMK, use ListKeys or DescribeKey. To get the alias name and alias ARN, use ListAliases.

		Specifies the encryption algorithm that will be used to decrypt the ciphertext. Specify the same algorithm that was used to encrypt the data.

The default value, SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT, represents the only supported algorithm that is valid for symmetric CMKs.
