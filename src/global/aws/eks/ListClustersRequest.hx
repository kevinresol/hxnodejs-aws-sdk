		The maximum number of cluster results returned by ListClusters in paginated output. When you use this parameter, ListClusters returns only maxResults results in a single page along with a nextToken response element. You can see the remaining results of the initial request by sending another ListClusters request with the returned nextToken value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If you don't use this parameter, ListClusters returns up to 100 results and a nextToken value if applicable.

		The nextToken value returned from a previous paginated ListClusters request where maxResults was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the nextToken value.  This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is used only to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.
