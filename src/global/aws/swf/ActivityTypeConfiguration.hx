		The default maximum time, in seconds, before which a worker processing a task must report progress by calling RecordActivityTaskHeartbeat. You can specify this value only when registering an activity type. The registered default value can be overridden when you schedule a task through the ScheduleActivityTask Decision. If the activity worker subsequently attempts to record a heartbeat or returns a result, the activity worker receives an UnknownResource fault. In this case, Amazon SWF no longer considers the activity task to be valid; the activity worker should clean up the activity task. The duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or equal to 0. You can use NONE to specify unlimited duration.

Higher numbers indicate higher priority. For more information about setting task priority, see Setting Task Priority in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide.
