With this endpoint type, you have the option to directly associate up to three Elastic IPv4 addresses (BYO IP included) with your server's endpoint and use VPC security groups to restrict traffic by the client's public IP address.

If Protocol includes either FTP or FTPS, then the EndpointType must be VPC and the IdentityProviderType must be API_GATEWAY. If Protocol includes FTP, then AddressAllocationIds cannot be associated. If Protocol is set only to SFTP, the EndpointType can be set to PUBLIC and the IdentityProviderType can be set to SERVICE_MANAGED.
