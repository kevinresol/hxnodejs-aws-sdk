		The value selected by the JsonPath expression must match what is supplied in the MatchEquals field. Otherwise, the request is ignored. Properties from the target action configuration can be included as placeholders in this value by surrounding the action configuration key with curly brackets. For example, if the value supplied here is "refs/heads/{Branch}" and the target action has an action configuration property called "Branch" with a value of "master", the MatchEquals value is evaluated as "refs/heads/master". For a list of action configuration properties for built-in action types, see Pipeline Structure Reference Action Requirements.
