		The type of push notification to send. Valid values are: alert - For a standard notification that's displayed on recipients' devices and prompts a recipient to interact with the notification. background - For a silent notification that delivers content in the background and isn't displayed on recipients' devices. complication - For a notification that contains update information for an appâ€™s complication timeline. fileprovider - For a notification that signals changes to a File Provider extension. mdm - For a notification that tells managed devices to contact the MDM server. voip - For a notification that provides information about an incoming VoIP call. Amazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the apns-push-type request header when it sends the notification message to APNs. If you don't specify a value for this property, Amazon Pinpoint sets the value to alert or background automatically, based on the value that you specify for the SilentPush or RawContent property of the message. For more information about the apns-push-type request header, see Sending Notification Requests to APNs on the Apple Developer website.

If you specify the raw content of an APNs push notification, the message payload has to include the content-available key. The value of the content-available key has to be an integer, and can only be 0 or 1. If you're sending a standard notification, set the value of content-available to 0. If you're sending a silent (background) notification, set the value of content-available to 1. Additionally, silent notification payloads can't include the alert, badge, or sound keys.

	/**
		Specifies whether the notification is a silent push notification. A silent (or background) push notification isn't displayed on recipients' devices. You can use silent push notifications to make small updates to your app, or to display messages in an in-app message center. Amazon Pinpoint uses this property to determine the correct value for the apns-push-type request header when it sends the notification message to APNs. If you specify a value of true for this property, Amazon Pinpoint sets the value for the apns-push-type header field to background. If you specify the raw content of an APNs push notification, the message payload has to include the content-available key. For silent (background) notifications, set the value of content-available to 1. Additionally, the message payload for a silent notification can't include the alert, badge, or sound keys. For more information, see Generating a Remote Notification and Pushing Background Updates to Your App on the Apple Developer website. Apple has indicated that they will throttle "excessive" background notifications based on current traffic volumes. To prevent your notifications being throttled, Apple recommends that you send no more than 3 silent push notifications to each recipient per hour.
