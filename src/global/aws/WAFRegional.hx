Creates a ByteMatchSet. You then use UpdateByteMatchSet to identify the part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect, such as the values of the User-Agent header or the query string. For example, you can create a ByteMatchSet that matches any requests with User-Agent headers that contain the string BadBot. You can then configure AWS WAF to reject those requests. To create and configure a ByteMatchSet, perform the following steps:   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of a CreateByteMatchSet request.   Submit a CreateByteMatchSet request.   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateByteMatchSet request.

		This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.  For the latest version of AWS WAF, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide. With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.   Creates a RateBasedRule. The RateBasedRule contains a RateLimit, which specifies the maximum number of requests that AWS WAF allows from a specified IP address in a five-minute period. The RateBasedRule also contains the IPSet objects, ByteMatchSet objects, and other predicates that identify the requests that you want to count or block if these requests exceed the RateLimit. If you add more than one predicate to a RateBasedRule, a request not only must exceed the RateLimit, but it also must match all the conditions to be counted or blocked. For example, suppose you add the following to a RateBasedRule:   An IPSet that matches the IP address 192.0.2.44/32    A ByteMatchSet that matches BadBot in the User-Agent header   Further, you specify a RateLimit of 1,000. You then add the RateBasedRule to a WebACL and specify that you want to block requests that meet the conditions in the rule. For a request to be blocked, it must come from the IP address 192.0.2.44 and the User-Agent header in the request must contain the value BadBot. Further, requests that match these two conditions must be received at a rate of more than 1,000 requests every five minutes. If both conditions are met and the rate is exceeded, AWS WAF blocks the requests. If the rate drops below 1,000 for a five-minute period, AWS WAF no longer blocks the requests. As a second example, suppose you want to limit requests to a particular page on your site. To do this, you could add the following to a RateBasedRule:   A ByteMatchSet with FieldToMatch of URI    A PositionalConstraint of STARTS_WITH    A TargetString of login    Further, you specify a RateLimit of 1,000. By adding this RateBasedRule to a WebACL, you could limit requests to your login page without affecting the rest of your site. To create and configure a RateBasedRule, perform the following steps:   Create and update the predicates that you want to include in the rule. For more information, see CreateByteMatchSet, CreateIPSet, and CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet.   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of a CreateRule request.   Submit a CreateRateBasedRule request.   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateRule request.   Submit an UpdateRateBasedRule request to specify the predicates that you want to include in the rule.   Create and update a WebACL that contains the RateBasedRule. For more information, see CreateWebACL.   For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide.

Creates a SqlInjectionMatchSet, which you use to allow, block, or count requests that contain snippets of SQL code in a specified part of web requests. AWS WAF searches for character sequences that are likely to be malicious strings. To create and configure a SqlInjectionMatchSet, perform the following steps:   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of a CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet request.   Submit a CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet request.   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateSqlInjectionMatchSet request.   Submit an UpdateSqlInjectionMatchSet request to specify the parts of web requests in which you want to allow, block, or count malicious SQL code.   For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide.

For the latest version of AWS WAF, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide. With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.   Creates a WebACL, which contains the Rules that identify the CloudFront web requests that you want to allow, block, or count. AWS WAF evaluates Rules in order based on the value of Priority for each Rule. You also specify a default action, either ALLOW or BLOCK. If a web request doesn't match any of the Rules in a WebACL, AWS WAF responds to the request with the default action.  To create and configure a WebACL, perform the following steps:   Create and update the ByteMatchSet objects and other predicates that you want to include in Rules. For more information, see CreateByteMatchSet, UpdateByteMatchSet, CreateIPSet, UpdateIPSet, CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet, and UpdateSqlInjectionMatchSet.   Create and update the Rules that you want to include in the WebACL. For more information, see CreateRule and UpdateRule.

Inserts or deletes Predicate objects in a rule and updates the RateLimit in the rule.  Each Predicate object identifies a predicate, such as a ByteMatchSet or an IPSet, that specifies the web requests that you want to block or count. The RateLimit specifies the number of requests every five minutes that triggers the rule. If you add more than one predicate to a RateBasedRule, a request must match all the predicates and exceed the RateLimit to be counted or blocked. For example, suppose you add the following to a RateBasedRule:   An IPSet that matches the IP address 192.0.2.44/32    A ByteMatchSet that matches BadBot in the User-Agent header   Further, you specify a RateLimit of 1,000. You then add the RateBasedRule to a WebACL and specify that you want to block requests that satisfy the rule. For a request to be blocked, it must come from the IP address 192.0.2.44 and the User-Agent header in the request must contain the value BadBot. Further, requests that match these two conditions much be received at a rate of more than 1,000 every five minutes. If the rate drops below this limit, AWS WAF no longer blocks the requests. As a second example, suppose you want to limit requests to a particular page on your site. To do this, you could add the following to a RateBasedRule:   A ByteMatchSet with FieldToMatch of URI    A PositionalConstraint of STARTS_WITH    A TargetString of login    Further, you specify a RateLimit of 1,000.

For the latest version of AWS WAF, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide. With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.   Inserts or deletes ActivatedRule objects in a RuleGroup. You can only insert REGULAR rules into a rule group. You can have a maximum of ten rules per rule group. To create and configure a RuleGroup, perform the following steps:   Create and update the Rules that you want to include in the RuleGroup. See CreateRule.   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateRuleGroup request.   Submit an UpdateRuleGroup request to add Rules to the RuleGroup.   Create and update a WebACL that contains the RuleGroup. See CreateWebACL.   If you want to replace one Rule with another, you delete the existing one and add the new one. For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide.

For the latest version of AWS WAF, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide. With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.   Inserts or deletes SizeConstraint objects (filters) in a SizeConstraintSet. For each SizeConstraint object, you specify the following values:    Whether to insert or delete the object from the array. If you want to change a SizeConstraintSetUpdate object, you delete the existing object and add a new one.   The part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to evaluate, such as the length of a query string or the length of the User-Agent header.   Whether to perform any transformations on the request, such as converting it to lowercase, before checking its length. Note that transformations of the request body are not supported because the AWS resource forwards only the first 8192 bytes of your request to AWS WAF. You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.   A ComparisonOperator used for evaluating the selected part of the request against the specified Size, such as equals, greater than, less than, and so on.   The length, in bytes, that you want AWS WAF to watch for in selected part of the request. The length is computed after applying the transformation.   For example, you can add a SizeConstraintSetUpdate object that matches web requests in which the length of the User-Agent header is greater than 100 bytes. You can then configure AWS WAF to block those requests. To create and configure a SizeConstraintSet, perform the following steps:   Create a SizeConstraintSet. For more information, see CreateSizeConstraintSet.   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateSizeConstraintSet request.   Submit an UpdateSizeConstraintSet request to specify the part of the request that you want AWS WAF to inspect (for example, the header or the URI) and the value that you want AWS WAF to watch for.

		This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.  For the latest version of AWS WAF, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide. With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.   Inserts or deletes ActivatedRule objects in a WebACL. Each Rule identifies web requests that you want to allow, block, or count. When you update a WebACL, you specify the following values:   A default action for the WebACL, either ALLOW or BLOCK. AWS WAF performs the default action if a request doesn't match the criteria in any of the Rules in a WebACL.   The Rules that you want to add or delete. If you want to replace one Rule with another, you delete the existing Rule and add the new one.   For each Rule, whether you want AWS WAF to allow requests, block requests, or count requests that match the conditions in the Rule.   The order in which you want AWS WAF to evaluate the Rules in a WebACL. If you add more than one Rule to a WebACL, AWS WAF evaluates each request against the Rules in order based on the value of Priority. (The Rule that has the lowest value for Priority is evaluated first.) When a web request matches all the predicates (such as ByteMatchSets and IPSets) in a Rule, AWS WAF immediately takes the corresponding action, allow or block, and doesn't evaluate the request against the remaining Rules in the WebACL, if any.    To create and configure a WebACL, perform the following steps:   Create and update the predicates that you want to include in Rules. For more information, see CreateByteMatchSet, UpdateByteMatchSet, CreateIPSet, UpdateIPSet, CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet, and UpdateSqlInjectionMatchSet.   Create and update the Rules that you want to include in the WebACL. For more information, see CreateRule and UpdateRule.   Create a WebACL. See CreateWebACL.   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateWebACL request.   Submit an UpdateWebACL request to specify the Rules that you want to include in the WebACL, to specify the default action, and to associate the WebACL with a CloudFront distribution.  The ActivatedRule can be a rule group. If you specify a rule group as your ActivatedRule , you can exclude specific rules from that rule group. If you already have a rule group associated with a web ACL and want to submit an UpdateWebACL request to exclude certain rules from that rule group, you must first remove the rule group from the web ACL, the re-insert it again, specifying the excluded rules. For details, see ActivatedRule$ExcludedRules .    Be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a web ACL without setting the rule type when first creating the rule, the UpdateWebACL request will fail because the request tries to add a REGULAR rule (the default rule type) with the specified ID, which does not exist.
