When used with the ECDSA_SHA_256, ECDSA_SHA_384, or ECDSA_SHA_512 signing algorithms, this value is a DER-encoded object as defined by ANS X9.62â€“2005 and RFC 3279 Section 2.2.3. This is the most commonly used signature format and is appropriate for most uses.    When you use the HTTP API or the AWS CLI, the value is Base64-encoded. Otherwise, it is not Base64-encoded.
