		The encryption key for the domain. This is used to encrypt content stored in a domain. An encryption key can be a key ID, a key Amazon Resource Name (ARN), a key alias, or a key alias ARN. To specify an encryptionKey, your IAM role must have kms:DescribeKey and kms:CreateGrant permissions on the encryption key that is used. For more information, see DescribeKey in the AWS Key Management Service API Reference and AWS KMS API Permissions Reference in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.    CodeArtifact supports only symmetric CMKs. Do not associate an asymmetric CMK with your domain. For more information, see Using symmetric and asymmetric keys in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
