		The filters.    architecture - The image architecture (i386 | x86_64 | arm64).    block-device-mapping.delete-on-termination - A Boolean value that indicates whether the Amazon EBS volume is deleted on instance termination.    block-device-mapping.device-name - The device name specified in the block device mapping (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh).    block-device-mapping.snapshot-id - The ID of the snapshot used for the EBS volume.    block-device-mapping.volume-size - The volume size of the EBS volume, in GiB.    block-device-mapping.volume-type - The volume type of the EBS volume (gp2 | io1 | st1 | sc1 | standard).    block-device-mapping.encrypted - A Boolean that indicates whether the EBS volume is encrypted.    description - The description of the image (provided during image creation).    ena-support - A Boolean that indicates whether enhanced networking with ENA is enabled.    hypervisor - The hypervisor type (ovm | xen).    image-id - The ID of the image.    image-type - The image type (machine | kernel | ramdisk).    is-public - A Boolean that indicates whether the image is public.    kernel-id - The kernel ID.    manifest-location - The location of the image manifest.    name - The name of the AMI (provided during image creation).    owner-alias - The owner alias, from an Amazon-maintained list (amazon | aws-marketplace). This is not the user-configured AWS account alias set using the IAM console. We recommend that you use the related parameter instead of this filter.    owner-id - The AWS account ID of the owner. We recommend that you use the related parameter instead of this filter.    platform - The platform. To only list Windows-based AMIs, use windows.    product-code - The product code.    product-code.type - The type of the product code (devpay | marketplace).    ramdisk-id - The RAM disk ID.    root-device-name - The device name of the root device volume (for example, /dev/sda1).    root-device-type - The type of the root device volume (ebs | instance-store).    state - The state of the image (available | pending | failed).    state-reason-code - The reason code for the state change.    state-reason-message - The message for the state change.    sriov-net-support - A value of simple indicates that enhanced networking with the Intel 82599 VF interface is enabled.    tag:&lt;key&gt; - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA, specify tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.    tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.    virtualization-type - The virtualization type (paravirtual | hvm).
