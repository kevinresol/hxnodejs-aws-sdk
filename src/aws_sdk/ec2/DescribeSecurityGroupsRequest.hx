		The filters. If using multiple filters for rules, the results include security groups for which any combination of rules - not necessarily a single rule - match all filters.    description - The description of the security group.    egress.ip-permission.cidr - An IPv4 CIDR block for an outbound security group rule.    egress.ip-permission.from-port - For an outbound rule, the start of port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an ICMP type number.    egress.ip-permission.group-id - The ID of a security group that has been referenced in an outbound security group rule.    egress.ip-permission.group-name - The name of a security group that has been referenced in an outbound security group rule.    egress.ip-permission.ipv6-cidr - An IPv6 CIDR block for an outbound security group rule.    egress.ip-permission.prefix-list-id - The ID of a prefix list to which a security group rule allows outbound access.    egress.ip-permission.protocol - The IP protocol for an outbound security group rule (tcp | udp | icmp or a protocol number).    egress.ip-permission.to-port - For an outbound rule, the end of port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an ICMP code.    egress.ip-permission.user-id - The ID of an AWS account that has been referenced in an outbound security group rule.    group-id - The ID of the security group.     group-name - The name of the security group.    ip-permission.cidr - An IPv4 CIDR block for an inbound security group rule.    ip-permission.from-port - For an inbound rule, the start of port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an ICMP type number.    ip-permission.group-id - The ID of a security group that has been referenced in an inbound security group rule.    ip-permission.group-name - The name of a security group that has been referenced in an inbound security group rule.    ip-permission.ipv6-cidr - An IPv6 CIDR block for an inbound security group rule.    ip-permission.prefix-list-id - The ID of a prefix list from which a security group rule allows inbound access.    ip-permission.protocol - The IP protocol for an inbound security group rule (tcp | udp | icmp or a protocol number).    ip-permission.to-port - For an inbound rule, the end of port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an ICMP code.    ip-permission.user-id - The ID of an AWS account that has been referenced in an inbound security group rule.    owner-id - The AWS account ID of the owner of the security group.    tag:&lt;key&gt; - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA, specify tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.    tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.    vpc-id - The ID of the VPC specified when the security group was created.
