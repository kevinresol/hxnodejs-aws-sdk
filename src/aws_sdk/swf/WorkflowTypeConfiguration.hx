		The default policy to use for the child workflow executions when a workflow execution of this type is terminated, by calling the TerminateWorkflowExecution action explicitly or due to an expired timeout. This default can be overridden when starting a workflow execution using the StartWorkflowExecution action or the StartChildWorkflowExecution Decision. The supported child policies are:    TERMINATE – The child executions are terminated.    REQUEST_CANCEL – A request to cancel is attempted for each child execution by recording a WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested event in its history. It is up to the decider to take appropriate actions when it receives an execution history with this event.    ABANDON – No action is taken. The child executions continue to run.
