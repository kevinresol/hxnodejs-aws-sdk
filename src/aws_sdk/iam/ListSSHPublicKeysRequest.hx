		The name of the IAM user to list SSH public keys for. If none is specified, the UserName field is determined implicitly based on the AWS access key used to sign the request. This parameter allows (through its regex pattern) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

		Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the IsTruncated response element is true. If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the IsTruncated response element returns true, and Marker contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.
