		Specifies whether or not API Gateway skips verification that the certificate for an integration endpoint is issued by a supported certificate authority. This isnâ€™t recommended, but it enables you to use certificates that are signed by private certificate authorities, or certificates that are self-signed. If enabled, API Gateway still performs basic certificate validation, which includes checking the certificate's expiration date, hostname, and presence of a root certificate authority. Supported only for HTTP and HTTP_PROXY integrations.
