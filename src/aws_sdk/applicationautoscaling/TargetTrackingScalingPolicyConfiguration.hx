		The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a previous scale-out activity to take effect. With the scale-out cooldown period, the intention is to continuously (but not excessively) scale out. After Application Auto Scaling successfully scales out using a target tracking scaling policy, it starts to calculate the cooldown time. While the scale-out cooldown period is in effect, the capacity added by the initiating scale-out activity is calculated as part of the desired capacity for the next scale-out activity. Application Auto Scaling provides a default value of 300 for the following scalable targets:   ECS services   Spot Fleet requests   EMR clusters   AppStream 2.0 fleets   Aurora DB clusters   Amazon SageMaker endpoint variants   Custom resources   For all other scalable targets, the default value is 0:   DynamoDB tables   DynamoDB global secondary indexes   Amazon Comprehend document classification endpoints   Lambda provisioned concurrency   Amazon Keyspaces tables

		The amount of time, in seconds, after a scale-in activity completes before another scale-in activity can start. With the scale-in cooldown period, the intention is to scale in conservatively to protect your applicationâ€™s availability, so scale-in activities are blocked until the cooldown period has expired. However, if another alarm triggers a scale-out activity during the scale-in cooldown period, Application Auto Scaling scales out the target immediately. In this case, the scale-in cooldown period stops and doesn't complete.
