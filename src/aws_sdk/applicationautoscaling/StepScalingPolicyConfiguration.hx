		The minimum value to scale by when scaling by percentages. For example, suppose that you create a step scaling policy to scale out an Amazon ECS service by 25 percent and you specify a MinAdjustmentMagnitude of 2. If the service has 4 tasks and the scaling policy is performed, 25 percent of 4 is 1. However, because you specified a MinAdjustmentMagnitude of 2, Application Auto Scaling scales out the service by 2 tasks. Valid only if the adjustment type is PercentChangeInCapacity.

	/**
		The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a previous scaling activity to take effect. With scale-out policies, the intention is to continuously (but not excessively) scale out. After Application Auto Scaling successfully scales out using a step scaling policy, it starts to calculate the cooldown time. While the cooldown period is in effect, capacity added by the initiating scale-out activity is calculated as part of the desired capacity for the next scale-out activity. For example, when an alarm triggers a step scaling policy to increase the capacity by 2, the scaling activity completes successfully, and a cooldown period starts. If the alarm triggers again during the cooldown period but at a more aggressive step adjustment of 3, the previous increase of 2 is considered part of the current capacity. Therefore, only 1 is added to the capacity. With scale-in policies, the intention is to scale in conservatively to protect your applicationâ€™s availability, so scale-in activities are blocked until the cooldown period has expired. However, if another alarm triggers a scale-out activity during the cooldown period after a scale-in activity, Application Auto Scaling scales out the target immediately. In this case, the cooldown period for the scale-in activity stops and doesn't complete. Application Auto Scaling provides a default value of 300 for the following scalable targets:   ECS services   Spot Fleet requests   EMR clusters   AppStream 2.0 fleets   Aurora DB clusters   Amazon SageMaker endpoint variants   Custom resources   For all other scalable targets, the default value is 0:   DynamoDB tables   DynamoDB global secondary indexes   Amazon Comprehend document classification endpoints   Lambda provisioned concurrency   Amazon Keyspaces tables
