	/**
		The identity's email address. If you do not provide a value for this parameter, you must specify a "From" address in the raw text of the message. (You can also specify both.)  Amazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described inRFC6531. For this reason, the local part of a source email address (the part of the email address that precedes the @ sign) may only contain 7-bit ASCII characters. If the domain part of an address (the part after the @ sign) contains non-ASCII characters, they must be encoded using Punycode, as described in RFC3492. The sender name (also known as the friendly name) may contain non-ASCII characters. These characters must be encoded using MIME encoded-word syntax, as described in RFC 2047. MIME encoded-word syntax uses the following form: =?charset?encoding?encoded-text?=.  If you specify the Source parameter and have feedback forwarding enabled, then bounces and complaints will be sent to this email address. This takes precedence over any Return-Path header that you might include in the raw text of the message.

		The raw email message itself. The message has to meet the following criteria:   The message has to contain a header and a body, separated by a blank line.   All of the required header fields must be present in the message.   Each part of a multipart MIME message must be formatted properly.   Attachments must be of a content type that Amazon SES supports. For a list on unsupported content types, see Unsupported Attachment Types in the Amazon SES Developer Guide.   The entire message must be base64-encoded.   If any of the MIME parts in your message contain content that is outside of the 7-bit ASCII character range, we highly recommend that you encode that content. For more information, see Sending Raw Email in the Amazon SES Developer Guide.   Per RFC 5321, the maximum length of each line of text, including the &lt;CRLF&gt;, must not exceed 1,000 characters.
