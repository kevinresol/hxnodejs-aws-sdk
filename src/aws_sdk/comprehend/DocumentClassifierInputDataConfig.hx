For example, if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix, if the prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file as input.

You can use a different character as a delimiter (if it's an allowed character) by specifying it under Delimiter for labels. If the training documents use a delimiter other than the default or the delimiter you specify, the labels on that line will be combined to make a single unique label, such as LABELLABELLABEL.
