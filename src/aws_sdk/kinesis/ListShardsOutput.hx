		When the number of shards in the data stream is greater than the default value for the MaxResults parameter, or if you explicitly specify a value for MaxResults that is less than the number of shards in the data stream, the response includes a pagination token named NextToken. You can specify this NextToken value in a subsequent call to ListShards to list the next set of shards. For more information about the use of this pagination token when calling the ListShards operation, see ListShardsInput$NextToken.  Tokens expire after 300 seconds. When you obtain a value for NextToken in the response to a call to ListShards, you have 300 seconds to use that value. If you specify an expired token in a call to ListShards, you get ExpiredNextTokenException.
