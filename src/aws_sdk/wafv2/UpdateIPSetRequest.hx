		Contains an array of strings that specify one or more IP addresses or blocks of IP addresses in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. AWS WAF supports all address ranges for IP versions IPv4 and IPv6.  Examples:    To configure AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated from the IP address 192.0.2.44, specify 192.0.2.44/32.   To configure AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated from IP addresses from 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255, specify 192.0.2.0/24.   To configure AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated from the IP address 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111, specify 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128.   To configure AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated from IP addresses 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 to 1111:0000:0000:0000:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff, specify 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/64.

		A token used for optimistic locking. AWS WAF returns a token to your get and list requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of the request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token, you provide the token to operations like update and delete. AWS WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update fails with a WAFOptimisticLockException. If this happens, perform another get, and use the new token returned by that operation.
