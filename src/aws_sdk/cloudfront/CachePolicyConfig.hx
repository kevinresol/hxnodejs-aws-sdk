		The default amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects to stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another request to the origin to see if the object has been updated.

For more information, see Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide. The default value for this field is 86400 seconds (one day).
