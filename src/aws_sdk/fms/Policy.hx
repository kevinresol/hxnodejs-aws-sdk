		Specifies the AWS account IDs and AWS Organizations organizational units (OUs) to include in the policy. Specifying an OU is the equivalent of specifying all accounts in the OU and in any of its child OUs, including any child OUs and accounts that are added at a later time. You can specify inclusions or exclusions, but not both. If you specify an IncludeMap, AWS Firewall Manager applies the policy to all accounts specified by the IncludeMap, and does not evaluate any ExcludeMap specifications. If you do not specify an IncludeMap, then Firewall Manager applies the policy to all accounts except for those specified by the ExcludeMap. You can specify account IDs, OUs, or a combination:    Specify account IDs by setting the key to ACCOUNT. For example, the following is a valid map: {“ACCOUNT” : [“accountID1”, “accountID2”]}.   Specify OUs by setting the key to ORG_UNIT. For example, the following is a valid map: {“ORG_UNIT” : [“ouid111”, “ouid112”]}.   Specify accounts and OUs together in a single map, separated with a comma. For example, the following is a valid map: {“ACCOUNT” : [“accountID1”, “accountID2”], “ORG_UNIT” : [“ouid111”, “ouid112”]}.
