		The value of OrientationCorrection is always null. If the input image is in .jpeg format, it might contain exchangeable image file format (Exif) metadata that includes the image's orientation.

Amazon Rekognition doesnâ€™t perform image correction for images in .png format and .jpeg images without orientation information in the image Exif metadata.
