		One or more key/value pairs or values to find in the query string. The maximum size of each string is 128 characters. The comparison is case insensitive.

To search for a literal '*' or '?' character in a query string, you must escape these characters in Values using a '\' character. If you specify multiple key/value pairs or values, the condition is satisfied if one of them is found in the query string.
